From Mud To Structure (see POSA Volume 1) Chapter 2
"		* The Layers pattern helps to structure applications that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks in which each group of subtasks is at a particular level of abstraction.
    * The Pipes and Filters pattern provides a structure for systems that process a stream of data. Each processing step is encapsulated in a filter component. Data is passed through pipes between adjacent filters. Recombining filters allows you to build families of related systems.
    * The Blackboard pattern pattern is useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known. In Blackboard several specialized subsystems assemble their knowledge to build a possibly partial or approximate solution."

OK - pretty clear that this is a Message Dispatcher (even references Reactor pattern0 from PoEI): http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/technology-management/0321200683/messaging-endpoints/ch10lev1sec8
